## The beginning of my story
- I have been passionate about building websites since my early teenage years, spending nearly 6–7 years fascinated by web development and dreaming of becoming a web developer. Along the way, my journey unexpectedly shifted toward graphic design, where I gained valuable creative experience.						       		
- During this time, I also launched a telegram channel dedicated to IT and gaming, which allowed me to explore my interests even further. My enthusiasm reached its peak — I felt confident and ready to step fully into the tech world. However, just as I was prepared to move forward, challenges with entering university put everything on pause.

## The Telegram Channel

- In the beginning, the purpose of this channel was simply to gather an audience and become more recognized. The main reason behind it was personal — at that time, I wanted to surpass people I once valued but who did not value me in return. Their channel growth and promotional collaborations made me feel jealous, which became a driving force for me.
- The channel was first launched under the name “Techno Life”, in collaboration with Sanjar Coder (Sanjar Alchinov, my friend, brother-like companion, and colleague from Jizzakh). Soon after, I achieved my initial goal — even when those I once envied added more members, their channels still couldn’t reach the same audience size and recognition that mine did. Moving from being ignored by them to no longer paying attention to them at all gave me a sense of inner peace.
- Later, the project turned into something more meaningful for us, and we continued under the name “ePlanet.” Together, we accomplished a lot — gathering nearly 2,000 subscribers and sharing unique content that couldn’t be found anywhere else. From creative posts and media to knowledge about technology and space, we poured deep research into every post, and the results reflected that effort.
- In the end, this channel became more than just a project — it showed us the path forward in IT.
